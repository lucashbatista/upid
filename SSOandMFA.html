    <h1>SSO and MFA Integration</h1>
            <p>Secure access should be seamless for users and uncompromising for security teams. 
            We help organizations design and implement Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
            that work together to reduce friction, eliminate password risk, and centralize access control across all applications.</p>
        <h2>What we deliver</h2>
            <p>We integrate SSO and MFA at the identity layer so security is enforced once, consistently, and at scale. 
                Instead of managing authentication separately in every application, your identity provider becomes the single source of truth.
                The result is a simpler login experience for users and stronger security for the business.
                </p>    
        <h2>How It Works</h2>        
            <p>Users authenticate through a trusted identity provider such as Okta, 
                Entra ID (Azure AD), Auth0, Ping, or Keycloak. MFA is enforced centrally based on your policies, 
                not hardcoded into applications. Once authentication is complete, secure tokens are issued and 
                trusted by your apps using modern standards like SAML and OpenID Connect.
                Your applications stay focused on business logic. Identity and security stay centralized.
                </p>    
        <h2>Key capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Single Sign-On across cloud and on-prem applications</li>
                <li>Multi-Factor AUthentication enforced at the Identity Provider</li>
                <li>Conditional and risk-based access policies</li>
                <li>Support for SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect(OIDC)</li>
                <li>Passwordless and phishing-resistant MFA options</li>
                <li>Role and group-based access control</li>
                <li>Centralized audit logging and compliance reporting</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>MFA That Matches Risk</h2>
            <p>Not every login needs the same level of friction. 
                We design MFA policies that adapt to real-world risk factors such as device trust, location, user role, and sensitivity of the application.
                High-risk or privileged access can require stronger authentication, while low-risk access remains fast and user-friendly.
                </p>
        <h2>Security Best Practices Built In</h2>
            <p>We enforce MFA centrally instead of per application, prioritize app-based or hardware MFA over SMS, 
                and ensure authentication context is passed securely to applications. 
                Privileged roles receive step-up authentication, and token lifetimes are tuned to balance usability and security.
                This approach aligns with Zero Trust principles and modern compliance requirements.
                </p>
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Organizations using integrated SSO and MFA experience fewer credential-related breaches, faster onboarding and offboarding, and significantly lower helpdesk costs. 
                Centralized access control improves visibility, simplifies audits, and supports frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA.
                Security improves without slowing the business down.
                </p>
        <h2>When you need SSO & MFA Integration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You manage multiple SaaS and Internal Applications</li>
                <li>You support a remote or hybrid workforce</li>
                <li>You handle sensitive or regulated data</li>
                <li>You need stronger protection for admins and privileged users</li>
                <li>You want a foundation for Zero Trust or passwordless access</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We start with your business goals and risk profile, not just tooling. 
                From identity provider selection to application integration and policy design, 
                we deliver an implementation that scales with your organization and fits your security maturity.</p>
